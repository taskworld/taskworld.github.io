Developer Mantra
=====

1. Iterate fast. **Speed** is of the essence.
2. Incrementalism over "moonshots". Borrow and enhance what's proven to work.
3. Don't over engineer. **Premature optimization is the root of all evil.** Remember; "You ain't gonna need it."
4. Beautiful Apps over Beatiful Code.
i.e. UX/UI (hard to get right) over back-end structure (not as hard to get right).
5. Stay on point
Do only what's currently a priority for the stakeholders and the team.
6. Experiment rapidly, all the time.
Progress = our rate of experimentaion.
7. Be passionate about what you're doing
8. Be engaged. Show that you care. Everyone notices if you don't
9. 1st rule of optimization: Don't. 2nd rule: Don't..yet. 3rd rule: Profile before optimizing.
10. The process is: Make it **work**. Then make it **right**. And, finally, make it **fast**.
